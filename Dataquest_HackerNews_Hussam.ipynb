    "#  Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News is a popular technology site on which people submit their posts related mainly to technology. It is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our goal here is to count average number of comments each post receives per hour. During an hour, a number of posts can be published by users. Average number of comments will simply be the total number of comments during an hour divided by total number of posts for that hour.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for the required analysis is downloaded from an online source and it contains around 300k rows. Below are descriptions of the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id`: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "- `title`: The title of the post\n",
    "- `url`: The URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL\n",
    "- `num_points`: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "- `num_comments`: The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "- `author`: The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "- `created_at`: The date and time at which the post was submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.\n",
    "Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting."
